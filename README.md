# Squil

I was curious about internal of databases so this is my attempt to implement one in Rust!
I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'm learning a lot.

What I want this database to have:

- SQL-like language
- SQLite architecture with simple implementation
- Single file database

## Features

- [x] REPL
- [] Tokenizer
- [] Parser
- [] Code generator

## References

- based on [Let's Build a Simple Database](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/)
